# Modelling-and-Simulation-of-Aerospace-System

# Simulation
This project is focus on the stability and accuracy domain of the implicit, explicit and hybrid integration schemes RKs, IRKs, BIs. The stability domain of an integration scheme is the key answer to know if the Ordinary Differential Equation System has been integrated properly or improperly. In this latter case it is possible to size the stepsize and obtain results that are the real solution or directly switch to an other type of numerical integration

# Modelling
During this project it was asked to model some of the main system on board like mechanical, electric, fluid-mechanical and thermal and to simulate their behavior. Particular attention has been payed for the proper integration scheme choice according to the eigenvalues of the system studied or in case of mixed systems, knowing the time of response of one system with respect to the other one.

### Installation
The program uses the basic MATLAB Toolbox.
