# Modelling-and-Simulation-of-Aerospace-System

### Project
## Simulation
This project is focus on the stability and accuracy domain of the implicit, explicit and hybrid integration schemes RKs, IRKs, BIs. The stability domain of an integration scheme is the key answer to know if the Ordinary Differential Equation System has been integrated properly or improperly. In this latter case it is possible to size the stepsize and obtain results that are the real solution or directly switch to an other type of numerical integration

# Installation
The program uses the basic MATLAB Toolbox.
